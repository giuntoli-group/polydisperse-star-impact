# Polydispersity improves the toughness and impact resistance of star-polymer thin films

This repository contains LAMMPS codes used in our paper to simulate the non-equilibrium behaviour of polydisperse star-polymer thin films. 

You can read our paper [here](). 

To run the scripts, execute

```bash
lmp -in in.create_melt
lmp -in in.projectile
```
